# Soft body dynamics

This project was created to aid a research project I did at Petnica science center (http://www.petnica.rs/), during the summer of 2012 between the end of high school and start of university.

The goal of the research was to create a soft body behavior model, that would be sufficiently simple to simulate in real tme. The goal was to achieve visually satisfying behavior, not physical accuracy.

The main aproach taken was to
